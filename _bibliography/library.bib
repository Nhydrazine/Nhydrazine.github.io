@article{snapper_1987aa,
	abstract = {Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and B cell stimulatory factor-1 (BSF-1), also known as interleukin-4, are T cell-derived lymphokines that have potent effects on B cell proliferation and differentiation. They are often secreted by distinct T cell clones. It is now shown that IFN-gamma stimulates the expression of immunoglobulin (Ig) of the IgG2a isotype and inhibits the production of IgG3, IgG1, IgG2b, and IgE. By contrast, BSF-1 has powerful effects in promoting switching to the expression of IgG1 and IgE but markedly inhibits IgM, IgG3, IgG2a, and IgG2b. These results indicate that BSF-1 and IFN-gamma as well as the T cells that produce them may act as reciprocal regulatory agents in the determination of Ig isotype responses. The effects of IFN-gamma and BSF-1 on isotype expression are independent.},

@article{moon_1989aa,
	abstract = {Mouse interleukin 4 (IL-4) has been shown to act on B cells as an induction factor for Ig class switch. We studied the characteristics of IL-4-regulated Ig isotype production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated splenic B-cell cultures with emphasis on the comparison between the IgG1 and IgE responses. The results show that the kinetics for the appearance of IgG1 and IgE isotypes are similar, but that the dose of IL-4 required for the induction of an IgE response is 3-10 times higher than that for an IgG1 response. No requirement for T cells was found for the induction of either isotype. Pre-incubation of cells for 24 h with IL-4 alone was sufficient to induce an IgG1 response when cells were recultured with LPS from days 1 to 6. However, the simultaneous presence of both IL-4 and LPS for at least 24 h was required for a detectable IgE response. For an optimal IgE response, IL-4 needed to be present for more than 72 h in LPS-activated cultures. The possible reasons for the different regulation of IgG1 and IgE responses are discussed.},

	abstract = {While it is well established that T cells play a prominent role in regulating Ig isotype switching in response to T-cell-dependent (TD) antigens, the events which control this process in response to antigens that do not recruit antigen-specific T cells (T-cell-independent (TI) antigens) is less clear. In this article, Clifford Snapper and James Mond suggest that the nature of the B-cell activator, in combination with cytokines produced by antigen non-specific cells, including macrophages, NK cells, and polyclonally activated B cells, may play an important role in the process leading to Ig isotype switching in response to TI antigens.},

@article{toellner_1996aa,
	abstract = {Immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch recombination is associated with the production and splicing of germline IgCH messenger RNA transcripts. Levels of gamma 1 transcripts in mouse spleen sections were assessed by semiquantitative analysis of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products during primary and secondary antibody responses to chicken gamma globulin (CGG). This was correlated with the appearance of CGG-specific B cells and their growth and differentiation to plasma cells. After primary immunization with CGG, gamma 1 switch transcripts appeared after 4 d, peaked at a median of six times starting levels between 10 and 18 d after immunization, and returned to background levels before secondary immunization at 5 wk. By contrast, after secondary challenge with CGG, a sevenfold increase in transcripts occurs during the first d. The level again doubles by day 3, when it is six times that which is seen at the peak of the primary response. After day 4, there was a gradual decline over the next 2-3 wk. Within 12 h of secondary immunization, antigen-specific memory B cells appeared in the outer I zone and by 24 h entered S phase, presumably as a result of cognate interaction with primed T cells. Over the next few hours, they migrated to the edge of the red pulp, where they grew exponentially until the fourth day, when they synchronously differentiated to become plasma cells. The same pattern was seen for the migration, growth, and differentiation of virgin hapten-specific B cells when CGG-primed mice were challenged with hapten protein. The continued production of transcripts after day 3 indicates that switching also occurs in germinal centers, but in a relatively small proportion of their B cells. The impressive early production of switch transcripts during T cell-dependent antibody responses occurs in cells that are about to undergo massive clonal expansion. It is argued that Ig class switching at this time, which is associated with cognate T cell-B cell interaction in the T zone, has a major impact on the class and subclasses of Ig produced during the response.},

	abstract = {The life history of isotype-switched B cells is unclear, in part, because of an inability to detect rare antigen-specific B cells at early times during the immune response. To address this issue, a small population of B cells carrying targeted antibody transgenes capable of class switching was monitored in immunized mice. After contacting helper T cells, the first switched B cells appeared in follicles rather than in the red pulp, as was expected. Later, some of the switched B cells transiently occupied the red pulp and marginal zone, whereas others persisted in germinal centers (GCs). Antigen-experienced IgM B cells were rarely found in GCs, indicating that these cells switched rapidly after entering GCs or did not persist in this environment.},

@article{turner_2010aa,
	abstract = {The selection of an appropriate Ig isotype is critical for an effective immune response against pathogens. Isotype regulation is sensitive to external signals, particularly cytokines secreted by Th cells. For example, IL-4 induces isotype switching to IgG1 via a STAT6-dependent signaling pathway. In this study, we show that BCR ligation also induces IgG1 switching in mouse B cells. The extent of switch induction by Ag is affinity-dependent, and high-affinity Ag binding leads to IgG1 switching levels comparable to those induced by saturating IL-4. However, the Ag-induced IgG1 switch does not require additional cytokine signals and occurs in a STAT6-independent manner. Thus, BCR ligation represents a novel pathway for direct isotype switching leading to IgG1 secretion.},

	abstract = {Neutrophils use immunoglobulins to clear antigen, but their role in immunoglobulin production is unknown. Here we identified neutrophils around the marginal zone (MZ) of the spleen, a B cell area specialized in T cell-independent immunoglobulin responses to circulating antigen. Neutrophils colonized peri-MZ areas after postnatal mucosal colonization by microbes and enhanced their B cell-helper function after receiving reprogramming signals, including interleukin 10 (IL-10), from splenic sinusoidal endothelial cells. Splenic neutrophils induced immunoglobulin class switching, somatic hypermutation and antibody production by activating MZ B cells through a mechanism that involved the cytokines BAFF, APRIL and IL-21. Neutropenic patients had fewer and hypomutated MZ B cells and a lower abundance of preimmune immunoglobulins to T cell-independent antigens, which indicates that neutrophils generate an innate layer of antimicrobial immunoglobulin defense by interacting with MZ B cells.},

	abstract = {IgH class switching occurs rapidly after activation of mature naive B cells, resulting in a switch from expression of IgM and IgD to expression of IgG, IgE, or IgA; this switch improves the ability of Abs to remove the pathogen that induces the humoral immune response. Class switching occurs by a deletional recombination between two switch regions, each of which is associated with a H chain constant region gene. Class switch recombination (CSR) is instigated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase, which converts cytosines in switch regions to uracils. The uracils are subsequently removed by two DNA-repair pathways, resulting in mutations, single-strand DNA breaks, and the double-strand breaks required for CSR. We discuss several aspects of CSR, including how CSR is induced, CSR in B cell progenitors, the roles of transcription and chromosomal looping in CSR, and the roles of certain DNA-repair enzymes in CSR.},

@article{chen_2019aa,
	abstract = {Class switch recombination (CSR) generates isotype-switched antibodies with distinct effector functions essential for mediating effective humoral immunity. CSR is catalyzed by activation-induced deaminase (AID) that initiates DNA lesions in the evolutionarily conserved switch (S) regions at the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) locus. AID-initiated DNA lesions are subsequently converted into DNA double stranded breaks (DSBs) in the S regions of Igh locus, repaired by non-homologous end-joining to effect CSR in mammalian B lymphocytes. While molecular mechanisms of CSR are well characterized, it remains less well understood how upstream signaling pathways regulate AID expression and CSR. B lymphocytes express multiple receptors including the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) and co-receptors (e.g., CD40). These receptors may share common signaling pathways or may use distinct signaling elements to regulate CSR. Here, we discuss how signals emanating from different receptors positively or negatively regulate AID expression and CSR.},

Dysregulation of CSR can cause self-reactive BCRs and B cell lymphomas; understanding the timing and location of CSR is therefore important. Although CSR commences upon T cell priming, it is generally considered a hallmark of germinal centers (GCs). Here, we have used multiple approaches to show that CSR is triggered prior to differentiation into GC B cells or plasmablasts and is greatly diminished in GCs. Despite finding a small percentage of GC B cells expressing germline transcripts, phylogenetic trees of GC BCRs from secondary lymphoid organs revealed that the vast majority of CSR events occurred prior to the onset of somatic hypermutation. As such, we have demonstrated the existence of IgM-dominated GCs, which are unlikely to occur under the assumption of ongoing switching.},

@article{fleming_2022aa,
	abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract is colonized by trillions of commensal microorganisms that collectively form the microbiome and make essential contributions to organism homeostasis. The intestinal immune system must tolerate these beneficial commensals, whilst preventing pathogenic organisms from systemic spread. Humoral immunity plays a key role in this process, with large quantities of immunoglobulin (Ig)A secreted into the lumen on a daily basis, regulating the microbiome and preventing bacteria from encroaching on the epithelium. However, there is an increasing appreciation of the role of IgG antibodies in intestinal immunity, including beneficial effects in neonatal immune development, pathogen and tumour resistance, but also of pathological effects in driving chronic inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These antibody isotypes differ in effector function, with IgG exhibiting more proinflammatory capabilities compared with IgA. Therefore, the process that leads to the generation of different antibody isotypes, class-switch recombination (CSR), requires careful regulation and is orchestrated by the immunological cues generated by the prevalent local challenge. In general, an initiating signal such as CD40 ligation on B cells leads to the induction of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), but a second cytokine-mediated signal determines which Ig heavy chain is expressed. Whilst the cytokines driving intestinal IgA responses are well-studied, there is less clarity on how IgG responses are generated in the intestine, and how these cues might become dysfunctional in IBD. Here, we review the key mechanisms regulating class switching to IgA vs IgG in the intestine, processes that could be therapeutically manipulated in infection and IBD.},

	abstract = {Destruction of cancer cells by therapeutic antibodies occurs, at least in part, through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and this can be mediated by various Fc-receptor-expressing immune cells, including neutrophils. However, the mechanism(s) by which neutrophils kill antibody-opsonized cancer cells has not been established. Here, we demonstrate that neutrophils can exert a mode of destruction of cancer cells, which involves antibody-mediated trogocytosis by neutrophils. Intimately associated with this is an active mechanical disruption of the cancer cell plasma membrane, leading to a lytic (i.e., necrotic) type of cancer cell death. Furthermore, this mode of destruction of antibody-opsonized cancer cells by neutrophils is potentiated by CD47-SIRPα checkpoint blockade. Collectively, these findings show that neutrophil ADCC toward cancer cells occurs by a mechanism of cytotoxicity called trogoptosis, which can be further improved by targeting CD47-SIRPα interactions.},

@article{goulet_2020aa,
	abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have become an important class of therapeutics, particularly in the realm of anticancer immunotherapy. While the two antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) of an mAb allow for high-avidity binding to molecular targets, the crystallizable fragment (Fc) engages immune effector elements. mAbs of the IgG class are used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and can elicit antitumor immune functions not only by several mechanisms including direct antigen engagement via their Fab arms but also by Fab binding to tumors combined with Fc engagement of complement component C1q and Fcγ receptors. Additionally, IgG binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) allows for endosomal recycling and prolonged serum half-life. To augment the effector functions or half-life of an IgG1 mAb, we constructed a novel "2Fc" mAb containing two Fc domains in addition to the normal two Fab domains. Structural and functional characterization of this 2Fc mAb demonstrated that it exists in a tetrahedral-like geometry and retains binding capacity via the Fab domains. Furthermore, duplication of the Fc region significantly enhanced avidity for Fc receptors FcγRI, FcγRIIIa, and FcRn, which manifested as a decrease in complex dissociation rate that was more pronounced at higher densities of receptor. At intermediate receptor density, the dissociation rate for Fc receptors was decreased 6- to 130-fold, resulting in apparent affinity increases of 7- to 42-fold. Stoichiometric analysis confirmed that each 2Fc mAb may simultaneously bind two molecules of FcγRI or four molecules of FcRn, which is double the stoichiometry of a wild-type mAb. In summary, duplication of the IgG Fc region allows for increased avidity to Fc receptors that could translate into clinically relevant enhancement of effector functions or pharmacokinetics.},

	abstract = {Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are undergoing continued development for applications in oncology and autoimmune diseases. While increasing activity by having more than one targeting arm, most BsAb engineering employs single Fc engagement as monoclonal antibodies. Here, we designed a novel immunoglobulin gamma-1 (IgG1)-derived dual-Fc BsAb containing two Fc regions and two distinct asymmetric antigen binding arms comprising a Fab arm and another VHH domain. In conjunction with the knob-into-hole technology, dual-Fc BsAbs could be produced with a high yield and good stability. We explore how Fc engineering effects on dual-Fc constructs could boost the desired therapeutic efficacy. This new format enabled simultaneous bispecific binding to corresponding antigens. Furthermore, compared to the one-Fc control molecules, dual-Fc BsAbs were shown to increase the avidity-based binding to FcγRs to result in higher ADCC and ADCP activities by potent avidity via binding to two antigens and Fc receptors. Overall, this novel BsAb format with enhanced effector functionalities provides a new option for antibody-based immunotherapy.},

A high resolution map of the binding site on human IgG1 for human Fc gamma RI, Fc gamma RIIA, Fc gamma RIIB, Fc gamma RIIIA, and FcRn receptors has been determined. A common set of IgG1 residues is involved in binding to all Fc gamma R; Fc gamma RII and Fc gamma RIII also utilize residues outside this common set. In addition to residues which, when altered, abrogated binding to one or more of the receptors, several residues were found that improved binding only to specific receptors or simultaneously improved binding to one type of receptor and reduced binding to another type. Select IgG1 variants with improved binding to Fc gamma RIIIA exhibited up to 100% enhancement in antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity using human effector cells; these variants included changes at residues not found at the binding interface in the IgG/Fc gamma RIIIA co-crystal structure (Sondermann, P., Huber, R., Oosthuizen, V., and Jacob, U.

@article{gruell_2022aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The administration of broadly neutralising anti-HIV-1 antibodies before latency reversal could facilitate elimination of HIV-1-infected CD4 T cells. We tested this concept by combining the broadly neutralising antibody 3BNC117 in combination with the latency-reversing agent romidepsin in people with HIV-1 who were taking suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART).
METHODS: We did a randomised, open-label, phase 2A trial at three university hospital centres in Denmark, Germany, and the USA. Eligible participants were virologically suppressed adults aged 18-65 years who were infected with HIV-1 and on ART for at least 18 months, with plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations of less than 50 copies per mL for at least 12 months, and a CD4 T-cell count of greater than 500 cells per μL. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 3BNC117 plus romidepsin or romidepsin alone in two cycles. All participants received intravenous infusions of romidepsin (5 mg/m2 given over 120 min) at weeks 0, 1, and 2 (treatment cycle 1) and weeks 8, 9, and 10 (treatment cycle 2). Those in the 3BNC117 plus romidepsin group received an intravenous infusion of 3BNC117 (30 mg/kg given over 60 min) 2 days before each treatment cycle. An analytic treatment interruption (ATI) of ART was done at week 24 in both groups. Our primary endpoint was time to viral rebound during analytic treatment interruption, which was assessed in all participants who completed both treatment cycles and ATI. We used a log-rank test to compare time to viral rebound during analytic treatment interruption between the two groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02850016. It is closed to new participants, and all follow-up is complete.
FINDINGS: Between March 20, 2017, and Aug 14, 2018, 22 people were enrolled and randomly assigned, 11 to the 3BNC117 plus romidepsin group and 11 to the romidepsin group. 19 participants completed both treatment cycles and the ATI: 11 in the 3BNC117 plus romidepsin group and 8 in the romidepsin group. The median time to viral rebound during ATI was 18 days (IQR 14-28) in the 3BNC117 plus romidepsin group and 28 days (21-35) in the romidepsin group B (p=0·0016). Although this difference was significant, prolongation of time to viral rebound was not clinically meaningful in either group. All participants in both groups reported adverse events, but overall the combination of 3BNC117 and romidepsin was safe. Two severe adverse events were observed in the romidepsin group during 48 weeks of follow-up, one of which-increased direct bilirubin-was judged to be related to treatment.
INTERPRETATION: The combination of 3BNC117 and romidepsin was safe but did not delay viral rebound during analytic treatment interruptions in individuals on long-term ART. The results of our trial could serve as a benchmark for further optimisation of HIV-1 curative strategies among people with HIV-1 who are taking suppressive ART.

In this phase 2a, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial, 43 people (85% males) with HIV-1 on ART were randomized to (1) placebo/placebo, (2) lefitolimod (TLR9 agonist)/placebo, (3) placebo/broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies (bNAbs) or (4) lefitolimod/bNAb. ART interruption (ATI) started at week 3. Lefitolimod was administered once weekly for the first 8 weeks, and bNAbs were administered twice, 1 d before and 3 weeks after ATI. The primary endpoint was time to loss of virologic control after ATI. The median delay in time to loss of virologic control compared to the placebo/placebo group was 0.5 weeks (P = 0.49), 12.5 weeks (P = 0.003) and 9.5 weeks (P = 0.004) in the lefitolimod/placebo, placebo/bNAb and lefitolimod/bNAb groups, respectively. Among secondary endpoints, viral doubling time was slower for bNAb groups compared to non-bNAb groups, and the interventions were overall safe. We observed no added benefit of lefitolimod. Despite subtherapeutic plasma bNAb levels, 36% (4/11) in the placebo/bNAb group compared to 0% (0/10) in the placebo/placebo group maintained virologic control after the 25-week ATI.

We present a robust heterodimeric Fc platform, called the XmAb{\textregistered} bispecific platform, engineered for efficient development of bispecific antibodies and Fc fusions of multiple formats. First, we engineer a purification solution for proteins containing a heterodimeric Fc using engineered isoelectric point differences in the Fc region that enable straightforward purification of the heterodimeric species. Then, we combine this purification solution with a novel set of Fc substitutions capable of achieving heterodimer yields over 95% with little change in thermostability. Next, we illustrate the flexibility of our heterodimeric Fc with a case study in which a wide range of tumor-associated antigen × CD3 bispecifics are generated, differing in choice of tumor antigen, affinities for both tumor antigen and CD3, and tumor antigen valency.

Fc interactions can also facilitate enhanced target clustering to evoke potent receptor signaling. These observations have driven decades-long research to delineate the properties within the Fc that elicit these various activities, identifying key amino acid residues and elucidating the important role of glycosylation. They have also fostered a growing interest in Fc-engineering whereby this knowledge is exploited to modulate Fc effector function to suit specific mechanisms of action and therapeutic purposes.

	abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are one of the most widely used drug platforms for infectious diseases or cancer therapeutics because they selectively target pathogens, infectious cells, cancerous cells, and even immune cells. In this way, they mediate the elimination of target molecules and cells with fewer side effects than other therapeutic modalities. In particular, cancer therapeutic mAbs can recognize cell-surface proteins on target cells and then kill the targeted cells by multiple mechanisms that are dependent upon a fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain interacting with effector Fc gamma receptors, including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis. Extensive engineering efforts have been made toward tuning Fc functions by either reinforcing (e.g. for targeted therapy) or disabling (e.g. for immune checkpoint blockade therapy) effector functions and prolonging the serum half-lives of antibodies, as necessary. In this report, we review Fc engineering efforts to improve therapeutic potency, and propose future antibody engineering directions that can fulfill unmet medical needs.},

@article{Saxena_2016aa,
	abstract = {Today, monoclonal immunoglobulin gamma (IgG) antibodies have become a major option in cancer therapy especially for the patients with advanced or metastatic cancers. Efficacy of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is achieved through both its antigen-binding fragment (Fab) and crystallizable fragment (Fc). Fab can specifically recognize tumor-associated antigen (TAA) and thus modulate TAA-linked downstream signaling pathways that may lead to the inhibition of tumor growth, induction of tumor apoptosis, and differentiation. The Fc region can further improve mAbs' efficacy by mediating effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis. Moreover, Fc is the region interacting with the neonatal Fc receptor in a pH-dependent manner that can slow down IgG's degradation and extend its serum half-life. Loss of the antibody Fc region dramatically shortens its serum half-life and weakens its anticancer effects. Given the essential roles that the Fc region plays in the modulation of the efficacy of mAb in cancer treatment, Fc engineering has been extensively studied in the past years. This review focuses on the recent advances in therapeutic Fc engineering that modulates its related effector functions and serum half-life. We also discuss the progress made in aglycosylated mAb development that may substantially reduce the cost of manufacture but maintain similar efficacies as conventional glycosylated mAb. Finally, we highlight several Fc engineering-based mAbs under clinical trials.},

Data from the non-human primate model and the first moderately protective HIV vaccine trial (RV144) point to a role for qualitative changes in humoral immune functions in protection from infection. Here, we review the current understanding of the antibody response throughout HIV infection, the known correlates of protection, and current strategies to manipulate antibodies to put an end to the epidemic.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies point to innate immune-recruiting antibody function in preventing infection as well as controlling viremia following infection. These data have begun to inform next-generation design of HIV vaccines and antibody therapies by uncovering new viral targets and antibody architectures to improve potency and breadth. Emerging data illustrate a role for innate immune recruiting-antibodies in conferring protection against HIV infection as well as promoting viral control and clearance, offering an unprecedented opportunity to modulate and improve antibody function to fight HIV more effectively.},

@article{Cassidy_2014aa,
	abstract = {The inhibitory receptors for MHC class I have a central role in controlling natural killer (NK) cell activity. Soon after their discovery, it was found that these receptors have a degree of peptide selectivity. Such peptide selectivity has been demonstrated for all inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) tested to date, certain activating KIR, and also members of the C-type lectin-like family of receptors. This selectivity is much broader than the peptide specificity of T cell receptors, with NK cell receptors recognizing peptide motifs, rather than individual peptides. Inhibitory receptors on NK cells can survey the peptide:MHC complexes expressed on the surface of target cells, therefore subsequent transduction of an inhibitory signal depends on the overall peptide content of these MHC class I complexes. Functionally, KIR-expressing NK cells have been shown to be unexpectedly sensitive to changes in the peptide content of MHC class I, as peptide:MHC class I complexes that weakly engage KIR can antagonize the inhibitory signals generated by engagement of stronger KIR-binding peptide:MHC class I complexes. This property provides KIR-expressing NK cells with the potential to recognize changes in the peptide:MHC class I repertoire, which may occur during viral infections and tumorigenesis. By contrast, in the presence of HLA class I leader peptides, virus-derived peptides can induce a synergistic inhibition of CD94:NKG2A-expressing NK cells through recruitment of CD94 in the absence of NKG2A. On the other hand, CD94:NKG2A-positive NK cells can be exquisitely sensitive to changes in the levels of MHC class I. Peptide antagonism and sensitivity to changes in MHC class I levels are properties that distinguish KIR and CD94:NKG2A. The subtle difference in the properties of NK cells expressing these receptors provides a rationale for having complementary inhibitory receptor systems for MHC class I.},

	abstract = {Antibodies that can bind to viruses but are unable to block infection in cell culture are known as "nonneutralizing antibodies." Such antibodies are nearly universally elicited following viral infection and have been characterized in viral infections such as influenza, rotavirus, cytomegalovirus, HIV, and SARS-CoV-2. It has been widely assumed that these nonneutralizing antibodies do not function in a protective way in vivo and therefore are not desirable targets of antiviral interventions; however, increasing evidence now shows this not to be true. Several virus-specific nonneutralizing antibody responses have been correlated with protection in human studies and also shown to significantly reduce virus replication in animal models. The mechanisms by which many of these antibodies function is only now coming to light. While nonneutralizing antibodies cannot prevent viruses entering their host cell, nonneutralizing antibodies work in the extracellular space to recruit effector proteins or cells that can destroy the antibody-virus complex. Other nonneutralizing antibodies exert their effects inside cells, either by blocking the virus life cycle directly or by recruiting the intracellular Fc receptor TRIM21. In this review, we will discuss the multitude of ways in which nonneutralizing antibodies function against a range of viral infections.},

	abstract = {For decades antibodies were largely thought to provide protection in extracellular spaces alone, mediating their effector functions by mechanisms such as entry-blocking, complement activation and phagocyte recruitment. However, a wealth of research has shown that antibodies are also capable of neutralising numerous viruses inside cells. Efficacy has now been demonstrated at virtually all intracellular stages of the viral life cycle. Antibodies can neutralise viruses in endosomes by blocking uncoating, fusion mechanisms, or new particle egress. Neutralisation can also occur in the cytosol via recruitment of the intracellular antibody receptor TRIM21. In addition to these direct neutralisation effects, recent research has shown that antibodies can mediate virus control indirectly by promoting MHC class I presentation and thereby increasing the CD8 T cell response. This provides valuable new insight into how non-neutralising antibodies can mediate potent protection in vivo. Overall, the importance of understanding the mechanisms of intracellular neutralisation by antibodies is highlighted by the ongoing need to develop new methods to control viruses. Using or inducing antibodies to block virus replication inside cells is now an innovative approach used by several vaccination and therapeutic strategies.},

	abstract = {Tripartite motif containing-21 (TRIM21) is a cytosolic ubiquitin ligase and antibody receptor that provides a last line of defense against invading viruses. It does so by acting as a sensor that intercepts antibody-coated viruses that have evaded extracellular neutralization and breached the cell membrane. Upon engagement of the Fc of antibodies bound to viruses, TRIM21 triggers a coordinated effector and signaling response that prevents viral replication while at the same time inducing an anti-viral cellular state. This dual effector function is tightly regulated by auto-ubiquitination and phosphorylation. Therapeutically, TRIM21 has been shown to be detrimental in adenovirus based gene therapy, while it may be favorably utilized to prevent tau aggregation in neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, TRIM21 may synergize with the complement system to block viral replication as well as transgene expression. TRIM21 can also be utilized as a research tool to deplete specific proteins in cells and zebrafish embryos. Here, we review our current biological understanding of TRIM21 in light of its versatile functions.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Rare patients naturally control HIV replication without antiretroviral therapy. Understanding the mechanisms implicated in natural HIV control will inform the development of immunotherapies against HIV. Elite controllers are known for developing efficient antiviral T-cell responses, but recent findings suggest that antibody responses also play a significant role in HIV control. We review the key studies that uncovered a potent memory B-cell response and highly functional anti-HIV antibodies in elite controllers, and explore the mechanisms that may account for the distinct properties of their humoral response.
RECENT FINDINGS: Elite controllers maintain a large HIV-specific memory B-cell pool that is sustained by efficient T follicular helper function. Neutralizing antibody rarely show high titers in controllers, but seem capable, at least in certain cases, of neutralizing contemporaneous viral strains. In addition, elite controllers display a unique HIV-specific antibody profile in terms of isotype, antigen specificity, and glycosylation pattern, resulting in polyfunctional antibody effector functions that may promote infected cell lysis and prime effectors of the antiviral immune response.
SUMMARY: Lessons from elite controller studies argue for the importance of integrating the many parameters defining a polyfunctional antibody response when evaluating candidate vaccines and immunotherapeutic approaches directed at HIV.},

Several types of these antigens have been recognized based on their cellular origins and expression patterns, while their detection has been greatly facilitated by recent achievements in next-generation sequencing and immunopeptidomics. Some of them have been targeted in clinical trials with various immunotherapy approaches, while many others remain untested. Here, we discuss molecular identification of different tumor antigen types, and the clinical safety and efficacy of targeting them with immunotherapy. Additionally, we suggest strategies to increase the efficacy and availability of antigen-directed immunotherapies for treatment of patients with metastatic cancer.},

	abstract = {Successful antiretroviral therapy (ART) can efficiently suppress Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) replication to undetectable levels, but rare populations of infected memory CD4+ T cells continue to persist, complicating viral eradication efforts. Memory T cells utilize distinct homing and adhesion molecules to enter, exit, or establish residence at diverse tissue sites, integrating cellular and environmental cues that maintain homeostasis and life-long protection against pathogens. Critical roles for T cell receptor and cytokine signals driving clonal expansion and memory generation during immunity generation are well established, but whether HIV-infected T cells can utilize similar mechanisms for their own long-term survival is unclear. How infected, but transcriptionally silent T cells maintain their recirculation potential through blood and peripheral tissues, or whether they acquire new capabilities to establish unique peripheral tissue niches, is also not well understood. In this review, we will discuss the cellular and molecular cues that are important for memory T cell homeostasis and highlight opportunities for HIV to hijack normal immunological processes to establish long-term viral persistence.},

	abstract = {Precision medicine requires highly scalable methods of multiplexed biomarker quantification that can accurately describe patient physiology. Unfortunately, contemporary molecular detection methods are generally limited to a dynamic range of sensitivity spanning just 3-4 orders of magnitude, whereas the actual physiological dynamic range of the human plasma proteome spans more than 10 orders of magnitude. Current methods rely on sample splitting and differential dilution to compensate for this mismatch, but such measures greatly limit the reproducibility and scalability that can be achieved-in particular, the effects of non-linear dilution can greatly confound the analysis of multiplexed assays. We describe here a two-pronged strategy for equalizing the signal generated by each analyte in a multiplexed panel, thereby enabling simultaneous quantification of targets spanning a wide range of concentrations. We apply our 'EVROS' strategy to a proximity ligation assay and demonstrate simultaneous quantification of four analytes present at concentrations spanning from low femtomolar to mid-nanomolar levels. In this initial demonstration, we achieve a dynamic range spanning seven orders of magnitude in a single 5 µl sample of undiluted human serum, highlighting the opportunity to achieve sensitive, accurate detection of diverse analytes in a highly multiplexed fashion.},

	abstract = {Antigen-experienced memory CD4+ T cells are the major target of HIV infection and support both productive and latent infections, thus playing a key role in HIV dissemination and persistence, respectively. Here, we reviewed studies that have shown direct association between HIV infection and antigen specificity. During untreated infection, some HIV-specific cells host productive infection, while other pathogen-specific cells such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis also contribute to viral persistence on antiretroviral therapy (ART). These patterns could be explained by phenotypic features differing between these pathogen-specific cells. Mechanisms involved in these preferential infection and selection processes include HIV entry and restriction, cell exhaustion, survival, self-renewal and immune escape. For instance, MIP-1β expressing cells such as CMV-specific memory cells were shown to resist infection by HIV CCR5 coreceptor downregulation/inhibition. Conversely, HIV-infected CMV-specific cells undergo clonal expansion during ART. We have identified several research areas that need further focus such as the role of other pathogens, viral genome intactness, inducibility and phenotypic features. However, given the sheer diversity of both the CD4+ T cell repertoire and antigenic history of each individual, studying HIV-infected, antigen-experienced cells still imposes numerous challenges.},

We compared the ability of IL-15 and IL-12 to enhance the cytotoxicity of neonatal (cord blood) and adult mononuclear cells (MNC) in both natural killer (NK) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays. Incubation with IL-15 (10 ng/ml) or IL-12 (1 ng/ml) for 18 h enhanced the NK activity (using K562 target cells) of both cord and adult MNC, increasing cord cell cytotoxicity threefold. Similar enhancement was seen in ADCC assays using erythrocyte targets and NK-resistant CEM cells coated with HIV gp-120 antigen. Incubation of cord cells with IL-15 or IL-12 for 1 week increased both NK and ADCC, although the combination produced less of an effect than either cytokine alone. IL-15 also increased the percentage of CD16+/CD56+ cells after 1 week incubation. This enhancement of NK and ADCC activities and the number of NK cells by IL-15 suggests it may be clinically useful in treating immunodeficient patients.},

In this study, the effects of interleukin-15 (IL-15) on neonatal NK cells was examined for up to 12 weeks in culture. The cytotoxicity of fresh neonatal mononuclear cells (MNC) as assayed by K562 cell killing is initially much less than that of adult MNC but increases more than eightfold after 2 weeks of culture with IL-15 to a level equivalent to that of adult cells. This high level of cytotoxicity was maintained for up to 12 weeks. In antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays using CEM cells coated with human immunodeficiency virus gp120 antigen, IL-15 greatly increased ADCC lysis by MNC from cord blood. IL-15 increased expression of the CD16+ CD56+ NK markers of cord MNC fivefold after 5 weeks of incubation. Cultures of neonatal MNC with IL-15 for up to 10 weeks resulted in a unique population of CD3- CD8+ CD56+ cells (more than 60%), which are not present in fresh cord MNC. These results show that IL-15 can stimulate neonatal NK cells and sustain their function for several weeks, which has implications for the clinical use of IL-15.},

They recognize infected cells and tumors using a sophisticated array of activating, costimulatory, and inhibitory receptors that are expressed on NK cell subsets to create extensive functional diversity. NK cells can be targeted to kill with exquisite antigen specificity by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. NK and T cells share many of the costimulatory and inhibitory receptors that are currently under evaluation in the clinic for cancer immunotherapy. As with T cells, genetic engineering is being employed to modify NK cells to specifically target them to tumors and to enhance their effector functions.

	abstract = {Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy has rapidly changed the field of cancer therapy. In 1997, the CD20-targeting mAb rituximab was the first mAb to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of cancer. Within two decades, dozens of mAbs entered the clinic for treatment of several hematological cancers and solid tumors, and numerous more are under clinical investigation. The success of mAbs as cancer therapeutics lies in their ability to induce various cytotoxic machineries against specific targets. These cytotoxic machineries include antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), which are all mediated via the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of mAbs. In this review article, we will outline the novel approaches of engineering these Fc domains of mAbs to enhance their Fc-effector function and thereby their anti-tumor potency, with specific focus to summarize their (pre-) clinical status for the treatment of B-cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), and multiple myeloma (MM).},

	abstract = {Macrophages are innate immune cells that derive from circulating monocytes, reside in all tissues, and participate in many states of pathology. Macrophages play a dichotomous role in cancer, where they promote tumor growth but also serve as critical immune effectors of therapeutic antibodies. Macrophages express all classes of Fcγ receptors, and they have immense potential to destroy tumors via the process of antibody-dependent phagocytosis. A number of studies have demonstrated that macrophage phagocytosis is a major mechanism of action of many antibodies approved to treat cancer. Consequently, a number of approaches to augment macrophage responses to therapeutic antibodies are under investigation, including the exploration of new targets and development of antibodies with enhanced functions. For example, the interaction of CD47 with signal-regulatory protein α (SIRPα) serves as a myeloid-specific immune checkpoint that limits the response of macrophages to antibody therapies, and CD47-blocking agents overcome this barrier to augment phagocytosis. The response of macrophages to antibody therapies can also be enhanced with engineered Fc variants, bispecific antibodies, or antibody-drug conjugates. Macrophages have demonstrated success as effectors of cancer immunotherapy, and further investigation will unlock their full potential for the benefit of patients.},
	annote = {Importance of macrophages in tumor antibody therapy. 

With conventional therapy the degree of macrophage infiltration into tumors is associated with poor prognosis because these tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) adopt a suppor-supporing phenotype that involves tissue repair and angigenesis. During RTX treatment, however, macrophage infiltration was associated with good prognosis, suggesting that antibody-mediated macrophage infiltration was helping to deplete tumor cells.

FcyR polymorphisms also affect the outcome of treatment. Lymphoma patients with 3a polymorphisms that increase Fc binding respond better to RTX therapy, and 2a binding polymorphisms are associated with better response in RTX, cetuximab and trastuzumab therapy.

Depletion of macrophages was proportionate to reduced depletion of B cells in anti-CD20 therapy and it was shown that depletion of B-cells in anti-CD20 therapy was driven by Kupffer cells in the liver and that this clearance also prevents metastases.

CD47 is a ``marker of self'' that prevents macrophages from phagocytosing.Upregulation of CD47 occurss in many types of cancer and prevents phagocytosis. 

Obinutuzumab is a glyco-engineered CD20 antibody approved for treament of CLL that has no fucose. Lazar et al. made variants of RTX and HER with modified Fcs and they enhanced ADCC and macrophage phago, and still anotehr CD19 antibody was enhanced with greater ADCC/CP and showed safety and efficacy in phase I (ref 72). Fc's with increased binding to 2a also increased macrophage-mediated destruction (ref 42).  Fc's with abolished FcyR binding in refs 74,75. Take a look.

	abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are a major component of cancer therapy. In this review, we summarize the different therapeutic mAbs that have been successfully developed against various tumor-expressed antigens and examine our current understanding of their different mechanisms of antitumor action. These mechanisms of action (MOA) largely center on the stimulation of different innate immune effector processes, which appear to be principally responsible for the efficacy of most unconjugated mAb therapies against cancer. This is evident in studies of mAbs targeting antigens for hematologic cancers, with emerging data also demonstrating the critical nature of innate immune-mediated mechanisms in the efficacy of anti-HER2 mAbs against solid HER2+ cancers. Although HER2-targeted mAbs were originally described as inhibitors of HER2-mediated signaling, multiple studies have since demonstrated these mAbs function largely through their engagement with Fc receptors to activate innate immune effector functions as well as complement activity. Next-generation mAbs are capitalizing on these MOAs through improvements to enhance Fc-activity, although regulation of these mechanisms may vary in different tumor microenvironments. In addition, novel antibody-drug conjugates have emerged as an important means to activate different MOAs. Although many unknowns remain, an improved understanding of these immunologic MOAs will be essential for the future of mAb therapy and cancer immunotherapy.},
	annote = {Rituximab approval first in 1997 then Herceptin was 1998. 

Only a few cancers have been successfully treated with mAbs and they are primarily hematologic malignancies (B-cell etc.). For solid tumors, the majority of mAbs that have been approved target HER2 or EGFR, although patritumab targets HER3. 

Table 1 is a great table of approved cancer antibodies.

Conjugated antibodies can carry toxic payloads etc.. But also developing TLR-stimulating payloads.

MOA for unconjugated antibodies can be receptor/signal blocking or driving effector function.

Addition of enhancement of effector function doesn't always translate to better clinical efficacy. For example, both murine and human alternatives to RTX that differ in binding sites and ability to alter CD20 signaling, although FDA approved, don't necessarily translate to massive clinical differences. 

For another example, cetuximab targets EGFR and is IgG1 ewhile panitumumab is IgG2 with no effector function. Panitumumab is less effective in some cancers (HNSCC) but Panitumumab and cetixumab are equal in treating colorectal cancer. So the clinical need for effector function is also dependent on the tumor type.

Conversely, mAbs targeting otehr markers, with IgG1 and strong ADCC/ADCP and some CDC, effector fucntion is indispensible for therapeutic activity.

HER2 amplified in 15% to 20% of breast cancers. Trastuzumab with chemotherapy is the standard of care. Clinical efficacy depends on effector function shown through xenograft studies. ADCP by macrophages was primary (ref 54). Margetuximab enhnced for FcyR3a and approved for use in failed HER2 treatement.

Trastuzumab may also be capable of activating HER2 immunity by enhancing antigen presenttion (refs 48,49,67,68). So there are other functions too.

Pertuzumab targets a different part of HER2 and synergizes with trastuzumab but whether this is effector-driven or not has not been investigated.

	abstract = {A hallmark of T cell dependent (TD) humoral immune responses is the generation of long-lived memory B cells. The generation of these cells occurs primarily in the germinal center (GC) reaction, where antigen-activated B cells undergo affinity maturation as a major consequence of the combined processes of proliferation, somatic hypermutation of their immunoglobulin V (IgV) region genes, and selection for improved affinity of their B-cell antigen receptors. As many B cells also undergo class-switching to IgG or IgA in these TD responses, there was traditionally a focus on class-switched memory B cells in both murine and human studies on memory B cells. However, it has become clear that there is also a large subset of IgM-expressing memory B cells, which have important phenotypic and functional similarities but also differences to class-switched memory B cells. There is an ongoing discussion about the origin of distinct subsets of human IgM+ B cells with somatically mutated IgV genes. We argue here that the vast majority of human IgM-expressing B cells with somatically mutated IgV genes in adults is indeed derived from GC reactions, even though a generation of some mostly lowly mutated IgM+ B cells from other differentiation pathways, mainly in early life, may exist.},

We briefly review 26 product candidates for which marketing applications are under consideration in at least one country or region, and 23 investigational antibody therapeutics that are forecast to enter regulatory review by the end of 2024 based on company disclosures. These nearly 50 product candidates include numerous innovative bispecific antibodies, such as odronextamab, ivonescimab, linvoseltamab, zenocutuzumab, and erfonrilimab, and antibody-drug conjugates, such as trastuzumab botidotin, patritumab deruxtecan, datopotamab deruxtecan, and MRG002, as well as a mixture of two immunocytokines (bifikafusp alfa and onfekafusp alfa). We also discuss clinical phase transition and overall approval success rates for antibody therapeutics, which are crucial to the biopharmaceutical industry because these rates inform decisions about resource allocation. Our analyses indicate that these molecules have approval success rates in the range of 14-32%, with higher rates associated with antibodies developed for non-cancer indications. Overall, our data suggest that antibody therapeutic development efforts by the biopharmaceutical industry are robust and increasingly successful.},

	abstract = {In the search for control of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection without antiretroviral therapy, posttreatment controllers (PTCs) are models of HIV remission. To better understand their mechanisms of control, we characterized the HIV blood reservoirs of 8 PTCs (median of 9.4 years after treatment interruption) in comparison with those of 13 natural HIV infection controllers (HICs) (median of 18 years of infection) and with those of individuals receiving efficient antiretroviral therapy initiated during either primary HIV infection (PHIs; n = 8) or chronic HIV infection (CHIs; n = 6). This characterization was performed with single-genome amplification and deep sequencing. The proviral diversity, which reflects the history of past viral replication, was lower in the PTCs, PHIs, and aviremic HICs than in the blipper HICs and CHIs. The proportions of intact and defective proviruses among the proviral pool in PTCs were not significantly different from those of other groups. When looking at the quantities of proviruses per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), they had similar amounts of intact proviruses as other groups but smaller amounts of defective proviruses than CHIs, suggesting a role of these forms in HIV pathogenesis. Two HICs but none of the PTCs harbored only proviruses with deletion in nef; these attenuated strains could contribute to viral control in these participants. We show, for the first time, the presence of intact proviruses and low viral diversity in PTCs long after treatment interruption, as well as the absence of evolution of the proviral quasispecies in subsequent samples. This reflects low residual replication over time. Further data are necessary to confirm these results. IMPORTANCE Most people living with HIV need antiretroviral therapy to control their infection and experience viral relapse in case of treatment interruption, because of viral reservoir (proviruses) persistence. Knowing that proviruses are very diverse and most of them are defective in treated individuals, we aimed to characterize the HIV blood reservoirs of posttreatment controllers (PTCs), rare models of drug-free remission, in comparison with spontaneous controllers and treated individuals. At a median time of 9 years after treatment interruption, which is unprecedented in the literature, we showed that the proportions and quantities of intact proviruses were similar between PTCs and other individuals. Unlike 2/7 spontaneous controllers who harbored only nef-deleted proviruses, which are attenuated strains, which could contribute to their control, no such case was observed in PTCs. Furthermore, PTCs displayed low viral genetic diversity and no evolution of their reservoirs, indicating very low residual replication, despite the presence of intact proviruses.},

	abstract = {HIV posttreatment controllers (PTCs) represent a natural model of sustained HIV remission, but they are rare and little is known about their viral reservoir. We obtained 1,450 proviral sequences after near-full-length amplification for 10 PTCs and 16 posttreatment noncontrollers (NCs). Before treatment interruption, the median intact and total reservoir size in PTCs was 7-fold lower than in NCs, but the proportion of intact, defective, and total clonally expanded proviral genomes was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Quantification of total but not intact proviral genome copies predicted sustained HIV remission as 81% of NCs, but none of the PTCs had a total proviral genome greater than 4 copies per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The results highlight the restricted intact and defective HIV reservoir in PTCs and suggest that total proviral genome burden could act as the first biomarker for identifying PTCs. Total and defective but not intact proviral copy numbers correlated with levels of cell-associated HIV RNA, activated NK cell percentages, and both HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ responses. These results support the concept that defective HIV genomes can lead to viral antigen production and interact with both the innate and adaptive immune systems.},

	abstract = {Elite controllers (ECs) represent a unique model of a functional cure for HIV-1 infection as these individuals develop HIV-specific immunity able to persistently suppress viremia. Because accumulating evidence suggests that HIV controllers generate antibodies with enhanced capacity to drive antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) that may contribute to viral containment, we profiled an array of extra-neutralizing antibody effector functions across HIV-infected populations with varying degrees of viral control to define the characteristics of antibodies associated with spontaneous control. While neither the overall magnitude of antibody titer nor individual effector functions were increased in ECs, a more functionally coordinated innate immune-recruiting response was observed. Specifically, ECs demonstrated polyfunctional humoral immune responses able to coordinately recruit ADCC, other NK functions, monocyte and neutrophil phagocytosis, and complement. This functionally coordinated response was associated with qualitatively superior IgG3/IgG1 responses, whereas HIV-specific IgG2/IgG4 responses, prevalent among viremic subjects, were associated with poorer overall antibody activity. Rather than linking viral control to any single activity, this study highlights the critical nature of functionally coordinated antibodies in HIV control and associates this polyfunctionality with preferential induction of potent antibody subclasses, supporting coordinated antibody activity as a goal in strategies directed at an HIV-1 functional cure.},

@article{kammers_2021aa,
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Low HIV viral load is associated with delayed disease progression and reduced HIV transmission. HIV controllers suppress viral load to low levels in the absence of antiretroviral treatment (ART). We used an antibody profiling system, VirScan, to compare antibody reactivity and specificity in HIV controllers, non-controllers with treatment-induced viral suppression, and viremic non-controllers.
METHODS: The VirScan library contains 3,384 phage-displayed peptides spanning the HIV proteome. Antibody reactivity to these peptides was measured in plasma from a Discovery Cohort that included 13 elite controllers, 27 viremic controllers, 12 viremic non-controllers, and 21 non-controllers who were virally suppressed on ART. Antibody reactivity to selected peptides was also assessed in an independent cohort of 29 elite controllers and 37 non-controllers who were virally suppressed on ART (Validation Cohort) and in a longitudinal cohort of non-controllers.
RESULTS: In the Discovery Cohort, 62 peptides were preferentially targeted in HIV controllers compared to non-controllers who were virally suppressed on ART. These specificities were not significantly different when comparing controllers versus viremic non-controllers. Aggregate reactivity to these peptides was also high in elite controllers from the independent Validation Cohort. The 62 peptides formed seven clusters of homologous epitopes in env, gag, integrase, and vpu. Reactivity to one of these clusters located in gag p17 was inversely correlated with viral load set point in an independent cohort of non-controllers.
CONCLUSIONS: Antibody reactivity was low in non-controllers suppressed on ART, but remained high in viremic controllers despite viral suppression. Antibodies in controllers and viremic non-controllers were directed against epitopes in diverse HIV proteins; higher reactivity against p17 peptides was associated with lower viral load set point. Further studies are needed to determine if these antibodies play a role in regulation of HIV viral load.},

	abstract = {Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) reduces HIV-associated morbidities and mortalities but cannot cure the infection. Given the difficulty of eradicating HIV-1, a functional cure for HIV-infected patients appears to be a more reachable short-term goal. We identified 14 HIV patients (post-treatment controllers [PTCs]) whose viremia remained controlled for several years after the interruption of prolonged cART initiated during the primary infection. Most PTCs lacked the protective HLA B alleles that are overrepresented in spontaneous HIV controllers (HICs); instead, they carried risk-associated HLA alleles that were largely absent among the HICs. Accordingly, the PTCs had poorer CD8+ T cell responses and more severe primary infections than the HICs did. Moreover, the incidence of viral control after the interruption of early antiretroviral therapy was higher among the PTCs than has been reported for spontaneous control. Off therapy, the PTCs were able to maintain and, in some cases, further reduce an extremely low viral reservoir. We found that long-lived HIV-infected CD4+ T cells contributed poorly to the total resting HIV reservoir in the PTCs because of a low rate of infection of na{\"\i}ve T cells and a skewed distribution of resting memory CD4+ T cell subsets. Our results show that early and prolonged cART may allow some individuals with a rather unfavorable background to achieve long-term infection control and may have important implications in the search for a functional HIV cure.},
	annote = {VISCONTI study

This is a study of 14 PTC from (a) a previous study from the same group, (b) ANRS CO6 PRIMO cohort and (c) recruited from hospital follow-up in France. They compare the PTC to HIV controllers from ANRS CO15/CO18 cohorts and viremic (non-controllers).

Protective HLA B*27 and B*57 alleles were not enriched in PTC and, in fact, PTC were slightly enriched for risk-associated B*07/B*35 alleles and some carried B*3501/B*3503 that are associated with rapid disease progression.

Reservoir sizes in PTC decreased from primary infection to the time of interruption, and then either remained stable or decreased even more throughout interruption (via. CADNA).

PTC reservoirs were more prominently focused in the transitional memory compartment of CD4+ T cells realtive to controllers, who were more dispersed between TTM and and central memory (TCM).

PTC had weaker HIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses than EC.

PTC also tended to have more severe primary infections than EC.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: HIV posttreatment controllers are rare individuals who start antiretroviral therapy (ART), but maintain HIV suppression after treatment interruption. The frequency of posttreatment control and posttreatment interruption viral dynamics have not been well characterized.
METHODS: Posttreatment controllers were identified from 14 studies and defined as individuals who underwent treatment interruption with viral loads ≤400 copies/mL at two-thirds or more of time points for ≥24 weeks. Viral load and CD4+ cell dynamics were compared between posttreatment controllers and noncontrollers.
RESULTS: Of the 67 posttreatment controllers identified, 38 initiated ART during early HIV infection. Posttreatment controllers were more frequently identified in those treated during early versus chronic infection (13% vs 4%, P < .001). In posttreatment controllers with weekly viral load monitoring, 45% had a peak posttreatment interruption viral load of ≥1000 copies/mL and 33% had a peak viral load ≥10000 copies/mL. Of posttreatment controllers, 55% maintained HIV control for 2 years, with approximately 20% maintaining control for ≥5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Posttreatment control was more commonly identified amongst early treated individuals, frequently characterized by early transient viral rebound and heterogeneous durability of HIV remission. These results may provide mechanistic insights and have implications for the design of trials aimed at achieving HIV remission.},
	annote = {CHAMP study CHAMPS
This is the original CHAMPS cohort paper where Jonathan Li puts together data from 14 studies totalling 67 PTC among 700 participants. They define PTC AS VIRAL LOADS <=400 cp/mL at >=2/3 of time points for >=24 weeks. This is a study of the viral load and CD4 dynamics post-interruption.

They found PTC were more common among early treated indiivduals than chronic (13% vs. 4% p<0.001) and that a subset of PTC had transient rebound during the first 24 weeks and then gained control. *this matches up with our different rebound dynamics groups*. Overall the observed 50% of PTC with peaks of 1000cp/mL and then a median decrease of 1.2 log over the next 2 weeks. 

They did not find a difference in time to peak viral load for PTC and NC, and they found that PTC maintained stable CD4 over 24 weeks than NC who lost a median of 221 CD4+/mL. 

They do mention individuals treated with NNRTI's, whiuch have a longer half life, so you can dig into this later.

Quote: During untreated acute infection the decline in viral load to setpoint coincides with HIV-specific cell-mediated immunity (ref 34). This is described as a potential mechanism driving the post-peak decrease in viral load observed for PTC.

They found that PTC was not always durable, with 50% maintaining control at 2 years and 20% at 5 years. 

A5068 was the self-vaccination study with ATI and they found a higher frequency of PTC among these patients than their other studies, particularly those involved in the ATI-only study arm. *again, this lines up with our analysis of the viral load dynamics as well*. But they note that ATI has yielded limited success refs 35,36.

	abstract = {Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) alters viral rebound kinetics after analytic treatment interruption (ATI) and may play a role in promoting HIV-1 remission. Autologous neutralizing antibodies (aNAbs) represent a key adaptive immune response in people living with HIV-1. We aimed to investigate the role of aNAbs in shaping post-ATI HIV-1 rebound variants. We performed single-genome amplification of HIV-1 env from pre-ART and post-ATI plasma samples of 12 individuals who initiated ART early after infection. aNAb activity was quantified using pseudoviruses derived from the most common plasma variant, and the serum dilution that inhibited 50% of viral infections was determined. aNAb responses matured while participants were on suppressive ART, because on-ART plasma and purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) demonstrated improved neutralizing activity against pre-ART HIV-1 strains when compared with pre-ART plasma or purified IgG. Post-ATI aNAb responses exerted selective pressure on the rebounding viruses, because the post-ATI HIV-1 strains were more resistant to post-ATI plasma neutralization compared with the pre-ART virus. Several pre-ATI features distinguished post-treatment controllers from noncontrollers, including an infecting HIV-1 sequence that was more similar to consensus HIV-1 subtype B, more restricted proviral diversity, and a stronger aNAb response. Post-treatment control was also associated with the evolution of distinct N-glycosylation profiles in the HIV-1 envelope. In summary, aNAb responses appeared to mature after early initiation of ART and applied selective pressure on rebounding viruses. The combination of aNAb activity with select HIV-1 sequence and reservoir features identified individuals with a greater chance of post-treatment control.},

	abstract = {HIV post-treatment controllers (PTCs) are rare individuals who maintain low levels of viremia after stopping antiretroviral therapy (ART). Understanding the mechanisms of HIV post-treatment control will inform development of strategies aiming at achieving HIV functional cure. In this study, we evaluated 22 PTCs from 8 AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) analytical treatment interruption (ATI) studies who maintained viral loads ≤400 copies/mL for ≥24 wk. There were no significant differences in demographics or frequency of protective and susceptible human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles between PTCs and post-treatment noncontrollers (NCs, n = 37). Unlike NCs, PTCs demonstrated a stable HIV reservoir measured by cell-associated RNA (CA-RNA) and intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA) during analytical treatment interruption (ATI). Immunologically, PTCs demonstrated significantly lower CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation, lower CD4+ T cell exhaustion, and more robust Gag-specific CD4+ T cell responses and natural killer (NK) cell responses. Sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) identified a set of features enriched in PTCs, including a higher CD4+ T cell% and CD4+/CD8+ ratio, more functional NK cells, and a lower CD4+ T cell exhaustion level. These results provide insights into the key viral reservoir features and immunological profiles for HIV PTCs and have implications for future studies evaluating interventions to achieve an HIV functional cure.},
	annote = {Broad study of serum features among PTC/NC. Find that:
PTC had a more stable reservoir post-interruption via. CA-RNA/CA-DNA
PTC had lower CD4/CD8 activation and stronger CD4+ gag response but not stronger CD8+ gag response. Lower levels of CD4+ exhaustion and stronger NK response.

Early rebound was median 4wk for NC, 12 wk for PTC while late rebound was median 16wk for NC and 96wk for PTC. So massive differences in the timepoint comparisons here. Despite this, NC still had higher levels of CA-DNA/RNA across both timepoint comparisons and in early ATI NC had higher levels of CD4 exhaustion markers.

The higher NK activity and, indeed, any higher-than-NC level of anything could be associated with the extreme differences in time between NC and PTC timepoints but they do focus on early ATI, which is 4wks vs. 16 weeks.

@article{Wedrychowski_2023aa,
	abstract = {Posttreatment controllers (PTCs) are rare HIV-infected individuals who can limit viral rebound after antiretroviral therapy interruption (ATI), but the mechanisms of this remain unclear. To investigate these mechanisms, we quantified various HIV RNA transcripts (via reverse transcription droplet digital PCR [RT-ddPCR]) and cellular transcriptomes (via RNA-seq) in blood cells from PTCs and noncontrollers (NCs) before and two time points after ATI. HIV transcription initiation did not significantly increase after ATI in PTCs or in NCs, whereas completed HIV transcripts increased at early ATI in both groups and multiply-spliced HIV transcripts increased only in NCs. Compared to NCs, PTCs showed lower levels of HIV DNA, more cell-associated HIV transcripts per total RNA at all times, no increase in multiply-spliced HIV RNA at early or late ATI, and a reduction in the ratio of completed/elongated HIV RNA after early ATI. NCs expressed higher levels of the IL-7 pathway before ATI and expressed higher levels of multiple cytokine, inflammation, HIV transcription, and cell death pathways after ATI. Compared to the baseline, the NCs upregulated interferon and cytokine (especially TNF) pathways during early and late ATI, whereas PTCs upregulated interferon and p53 pathways only at early ATI and downregulated gene translation during early and late ATI. In NCs, viral rebound after ATI is associated with increases in HIV transcriptional completion and splicing, rather than initiation. Differences in HIV and cellular transcription may contribute to posttreatment control, including an early limitation of spliced HIV RNA, a delayed reduction in completed HIV transcripts, and the differential expression of the IL-7, p53, and TNF pathways. IMPORTANCE The findings presented here provide new insights into how HIV and cellular gene expression change after stopping ART in both noncontrollers and posttreatment controllers. Posttreatment control is associated with an early ability to limit increases in multiply-spliced HIV RNA, a delayed (and presumably immune-mediated) ability to reverse an initial rise in processive/completed HIV transcripts, and multiple differences in cellular gene expression pathways. These differences may represent correlates or mechanisms of posttreatment control and may provide insight into the development and/or monitoring of therapeutic strategies that are aimed at a functional HIV cure.},
	annote = {The authors study transcriptomic properties of PTC and NC among the CHAMPS cohort. The found that PTC tended to have lower levels of HIV transcription initiation, lower levels of transient/intermediate transcripts and lower levels of multiply spliced tat/rev as well as lower levels of full genome transcripts (e.g. for packaging into nascent particles). PTC and NC showed little difference pre-ATI, as these differences manifested during early rebound. The reduced multiple splicing among PTC goes away when they become viremic, so this is something that doesn't last.

NC were higher in TNFa. which increases NF-KB translocation and HIV transcription as well as IL-1, which is associated with pyroptosis and abortive infection of CD4+ T cells (see ref 29). They also had more persistent IFN signaling, indicating inflammatory activity.

I think these signatures are surrogate indicators of control but are not the actual mechanisms of control.},

Such biomarkers can improve the safety of analytic treatment interruption (ATI) and provide mechanistic insights into the host pathways involved in post-ART HIV control. Here we report plasma glycomic and metabolic signatures of time-to-viral-rebound and probability-of-viral-remission using samples from two independent cohorts. These samples include a large number of post-treatment controllers, a rare population demonstrating sustained virologic suppression after ART-cessation. These signatures remain significant after adjusting for key demographic and clinical confounders. We also report mechanistic links between some of these biomarkers and HIV latency reactivation and/or myeloid inflammation in vitro. Finally, machine learning algorithms, based on selected sets of these biomarkers, predict time-to-viral-rebound with 74% capacity and probability-of-viral-remission with 97.5% capacity. In summary, we report non-invasive plasma biomarkers, with potential functional significance, that predict both the duration and probability of HIV remission after treatment interruption.},
	annote = {The authors are interested in identifying plasma glycomic and metabolomic signatures of time to viral rebound and likelihood of remission (e.g. PTC). They assess both IgG glycosylation profiles as well as plasma glycans and metabolites of a subset of the CHAMPS cohort.

Metabolites: glutamic acid was associated with delayed reboundand a higher probability of being PTC. Glu is linked to anti-inflammatory activity and in vitro studies in this paper show that Glu can suppress activation of myeloid cells. Glu also negatively correlated to cell-associated DNA. Pyruvic acid was associated with more rapid progression and was shown in vitro to induce more proinflammatry phenotypes in myeloid cells. Pyruvic acid positively correlated to cell-associated DNA. Ethylmalonic acid was associated with delayed rebound and also has anti-inflammatory properties.

IgG glycome: core fucose is (generally) associated with low CD16 binding adn weak ADCC (this is a general note). Pre-ATI IgG G2 was associatred with delayed rebound and is linked to anti-inflammatory properties. G2 is the only glycan that is terminally galactosylated and not fucosylated or sialylated, so this is compatible with higher ADCC activity.

Plasma glycome: high plasma levels of fucose was associated with delayed rebound but the mechanism is unknown. High plasma GlcNAc was associated with accellerated rebound and reduced PTC frequency, however, again, the mechanism is unclear.

We briefly describe an interactive tool for predicting viral rebound timing in ATI trials and the impact of posttreatment controller (PTC) definitions on PTC frequency estimates.

It will give you a graph of the percentage of PTC and NC that are suppressed across post-interruption timepoints. It uses the CHAMPS cohort data.

They varied the parameters and found that the threshold of 1000cp/mL for 4 weeks had a good balance of matching the frequency of PTC with the pre-determined clinical definitions of PTC in this cohort. They also tried different definitions of PTC and found that in almost all definitions, more PTC were identified in the early treatment group than the chronic group. They did find that several parameter medians remained the same regardless of the definition of PTC such as pre-ART viral load, peak viral load, CD4+ decline and baseline CD4+.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Development of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remission strategies requires precise information on time to HIV rebound after treatment interruption, but there is uncertainty regarding whether modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens and timing of ART initiation may affect this outcome.
METHODS: AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) A5345 enrolled individuals who initiated ART during chronic or early HIV infection and on suppressive ART for ≥2 years. Participants underwent carefully monitored antiretroviral interruption. ART was restarted upon 2 successive viral loads ≥1000 copies/mL. We compared participants of A5345 with participants of 6 historic ACTG treatment interruption studies.
RESULTS: Thirty-three chronic-treated and 12 early-treated participants interrupted ART with evaluable time to viral rebound. Median time to viral rebound ≥1000 HIV RNA copies/mL was 22 days. Acute retroviral rebound syndrome was diagnosed in 9% of the chronic-treated and none of the early-treated individuals. All participants of the historic studies were on older protease inhibitor-based regimens, whereas 97% of A5345 participants were on integrase inhibitor-based ART. There were no differences in the timing of viral rebound comparing A5345 versus historic studies. In a combined analysis, a higher percentage of early-treated participants remained off ART at posttreatment interruption week 12 (chronic vs early: 2% vs 9%, P = .0496). One chronic-treated and one early-treated A5345 participant remained off ART for >24 weeks. All participants resuppressed after ART reinitiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Early ART initiation, using either older or newer ART regimens, was associated with a significant delay in the time to HIV rebound after ART interruption, lowering the barrier for HIV remission.},
	annote = {Clinical trial ATCH A5345, chronice/acute treatment, ART >2 years, just treatment interruption study.

This is a clinical trial written up by Jonathan Li and ATCG A5345 where they are just looking at rebound kinetics among patients stopping treatment. The primary goals were to determine whether treatment regiment and/or chronic/early treatment were associated with rebound kinetics. THree kintic endpoints were used: time to >=50cp/mL, time to >=1000cp/mL and time to detection (e.g. RNA was detected but below the threshold for quantification).

They found that early treatment was associated with a modest delay in rebound (relative to chronic) and that this was most dramatic for the time-to-detection, less dramatic for 50cp/mL and there was no difference for 1000cp/mL. They also found that the time to rebounds were the same when comparing historical samples with treatments involving protease inhibitors (PI) vs. the more modern A5345 samples, which primarily involved the more modern integrase inhibitors. So no difference in regimen. But the pre-treatment characteristics of the historical patients was way different than those of A5345 participants.

They did find that early treatment resulted in a significant increase in the likelihood of a patient remaining off of ART at week 12.

	abstract = {Antiretroviral therapy (ART) effectively controls HIV infection, suppressing HIV viral loads. Typically suspension of therapy is rapidly followed by rebound of viral loads to high, pre-therapy levels. Indeed, a recent study showed that approximately 90% of treatment interruption study participants show viral rebound within at most a few months of therapy suspension, but the remaining 10%, showed viral rebound some months, or years, after ART suspension. Some may even never rebound. We investigate and compare branching process models aimed at gaining insight into these viral dynamics. Specifically, we provide a theory that explains both short- and long-term viral rebounds, and post-treatment control, via a multitype branching process with time-inhomogeneous rates, validated with data from Li et al. (Li et al. 2016 AIDS30, 343-353. (doi:10.1097/QAD.0000000000000953)). We discuss the associated biological interpretation and implications of our best-fit model. To test the effectiveness of an experimental intervention in delaying or preventing rebound, the standard practice is to suspend therapy and monitor the study participants for rebound. We close with a discussion of an important application of our modelling in the design of such clinical trials.},
	annote = {The authors are concerned with understanding and modeling the viral load dynamics of rebound. Existing models based on survival curves are okay at describing short-term rebound (the typical rapid curve) but don't do well at describing the long-term rebound seen with post-treatment controllers. The authors want to come up with a model that will accommodate both, because roughly 10% of rebounders are PTC. They are using viral load and other clinical data from the CHAMPS cohort.

They incorporate a variety of biological factors, the details are in the paper. Of importance is the recrudescence rate, which reflects the probability that a single activated latent cell will lead to viral rebound. By incorporating this rate they can accommodate the slower rebound kinetics of PTC and make a more generalized model. *what are the virological/biologicla factors that they incorporate into this rate?* 

Existing models typically assume that this reactivaiton rate is constant for all patients. The authors provide a really good description of different factors for why this rate should not be constant, including integration sites, reactivation threshold requirements etc{\ldots}

Among their data they report an average recrudescence frequency of once every 9.4-14 days, so an average post-interruption delay of about 9-14 days. This is also what we see in our data (depending on the viral load threhsold used).

	abstract = {Plasma viremia reoccurs in most HIV-infected individuals once antiretroviral therapy (ART) is interrupted. The kinetics of viral rebound, specifically the time until plasma virus becomes detectable, differ quite substantially between individuals, and associations with virological and immunological factors have been suggested. Standard clinical measures, like CD4 T-cell counts and plasma HIV RNA levels, however, are poor predictive markers. Antibody features, including Fc functionality and Fc glycosylation have been identified as sensitive surrogates for disease activity in multiple diseases. Here, we analyzed HIV-specific antibody quantities and qualitative differences like antibody-mediated functions, Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) binding, and IgG Fc glycosylation as well as cytokine profiles and cellular HIV DNA and RNA levels in 23 ART-suppressed individuals prior to undergoing an analytical ART interruption (ATI). We found that antibodies with distinct functional properties and Fc glycan signatures separated individuals into early and delayed viral rebounders (≤4 weeks versus >4 weeks) and tracked with levels of inflammatory cytokines and transcriptional activity of the viral reservoir. Specifically, individuals with early viral rebound exhibited higher levels of total HIV-specific IgGs carrying inflammatory Fc glycans, while delayed rebounders showed an enrichment of highly functional antibodies. Overall, only four features, including enhanced antibody-mediated NK cell activation in delayed rebounders, were necessary to discriminate the groups. These data suggest that antibody features can be used as sensitive indicators of HIV disease activity and could be included in future ATI studies.IMPORTANCE Plasma viremia reoccurs in most HIV-infected individuals once antiretroviral therapy is interrupted, and interindividual differences in the kinetics of viral rebound have been associated with virological and immunological factors.

Want to know if there are humoral features that can be used as biomarkers for predicting whether someone will experience a rapid rebound or delayed rebound. So they focused on the time at which a patient becomes detectible after stopping treatment. They separated into patients who were detectible <4 weeks >4 weeks post.

PCA separated the 4-week division groups fairly well and the minimal, primary components were Env titers (gp140) and the three NK markers (CD107a, IFNy, MIP1b). This coincides with a higher FcyR3a binding for late rebounders.

THey found that the early rebounders had more gp120/140 titers but that late rebounders had higher titer-normalized function. This suggests that the early rebounders had a higeher inflammatory milieu. 

They also found the early rebounders had way higher CA-RNA, which could explain both the early rebound and the inflammatory signature.

	abstract = {The nature of activation signals is essential in determining T cell subset differentiation; however, the features that determine T cell subset preference acquired during intrathymic development remain elusive. Here we show that naive CD4+ T cells generated in the mouse thymic microenvironment lacking Scd1, encoding the enzyme catalyzing oleic acid (OA) production, exhibit enhanced regulatory T (Treg) cell differentiation and attenuated development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Scd1 deletion in K14+ thymic epithelia recapitulated the enhanced Treg cell differentiation phenotype of Scd1-deficient mice. The dearth of OA permitted DOT1L to increase H3K79me2 levels at the Atp2a2 locus of thymocytes at the DN2--DN3 transition stage. Such epigenetic modification persisted in naive CD4+ T cells and facilitated Atp2a2 expression. Upon T cell receptor activation, ATP2A2 enhanced the activity of the calcium--NFAT1--Foxp3 axis to promote naive CD4+ T cells to differentiate into Treg cells. Therefore, OA availability is critical for preprogramming thymocytes with Treg cell differentiation propensities in the periphery.},
	annote = {T-cells develop from stem cell thymocytes in the thymus through at least 4 developmental stages (DN1-DN4) before being released into the periphery as naive T cells. Once released, they can encounter antigens and cytokines that stimulate them to follow a variety of differentiation paths to become, for example, Th1 or Treg.

This study is interested in understanding how changes during the early thymic developmental stages might affect the propensity of a CD4+ T cell to adopt a Th1 or Treg fate after leaving the thymus. Specifically, they are investingating the impact of changes in lipid metabolism during thymic development. They focus on Scd1, an enzyme that caralyzes the formation of oleic acid in the fatty acid synthesis pathway.

They find that CD4+ T cells in mice have a stronger propensity to adopt the Treg fate when Scd1 is knocked out or when oleic acid is limiting, specifically during the DN2-DN3 developmental stages. This was also linked to changes in ATP2A2 expression and intracellular calcium, but these downstream effects are more general effects that can occur for a variety of other reasons (possibly experimental). 

Thymic T-cell generation (lyphpoiesis) doesn't really happen in adults but can happen following ly,phopenia induced by chemotherapy or infection. Limiting OA production/availability (even via. diet) during chemotherapy or infection could increase Treg propensity and help to treat autoimmune disorders. },

	abstract = {Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination can confer nonspecific protection against heterologous pathogens. However, the underlying mechanisms remain mysterious. We show that mice vaccinated intravenously with BCG exhibited reduced weight loss and/or improved viral clearance when challenged with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351) or PR8 influenza. Protection was first evident between 14 and 21 d post-vaccination and lasted ~3 months. Notably, BCG induced a biphasic innate response and robust antigen-specific type 1 helper T cell (TH1 cell) responses in the lungs. MyD88 signaling was essential for innate and TH1 cell responses, and protection against SARS-CoV-2. Depletion of CD4+ T cells or interferon (IFN)-y activity before infection obliterated innate activation and protection. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics revealed CD4-dependent expression of IFN-stimulated genes in lung myeloid and epithelial cells. Notably, BCG also induced protection against weight loss after mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 BA.5, SARS-CoV and SHC014 coronavirus infections. Thus, BCG elicits integrated organ immunity, where CD4+ T cells feed back on tissue myeloid and epithelial cells to imprint prolonged and broad innate antiviral resistance.},
	annote = {BCG vaccination for TB seems to also confer protection against a broad variety of other pathogens/infections including influenza. This paper is trying to understand the mechanism by which this happens.

They found that BCG vaccination induces a strong CD4+ Th1 response involving high levels of IFNy production and that this primes innate cells in an activated state so that they can efficiently tackle new pathogens that arise during this activation period. 

They show that high IFNy (and other inflammatory, Th1-like cytokines) peak around 21-28 days post vaccination in mice and this is where they are most protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection. They also show that secretion largely occurs in the lung and epithelium, which is the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, BCG vaccination did NOT confer SARS-CoV-2 protection at days 7 or 14 post-vaccination, but this lined up with the peak IFNy/cytokine expression.

The authors think that the kinetics of this process are related to BCG vaccine and its attenuated replication rate and the timing there the vaccine reaches a critical threshold to induce inflammation. So will likely be different with other strains/vaccines.

The authors do describe this as the BCG vaccine giving innate cells in the lung a ``hightened state'', of activation/inflammation.

In the end, I'm not sure how this is different from just driving inflammation in whatever tissue is relevant for the secondary pathogen. I suppose you could use vaccines that stimulate different tissues, thereby preventing infeciton of pathogens specfic for those tissues. What about antibodies? Is there a way to target tissues with antibodies in a way that will also induce low-level inflammation - enough to prevent the establishment of infection in a broad way? Are there pathogens that would benefit from an inflammatory prelude? (e.g. HIV?).

Here, using intravital two-photon microscopy in mice, we observe transient contacts between MZ B cells and red blood cells that are in flow. We show that MZ B cells use adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor ADGRE5 (CD97) for retention in the spleen. CD97 function in
MZ B cells depends on its ability to undergo autoproteolytic cleavage and signaling via Gα13 and ARHGEF1. Red blood cell expression of the CD97 ligand CD55 is required for MZ B cell homeostasis. Applying a pulling force on CD97-transfected cells using an optical C-trap and CD55+ beads leads to accumulation of active RhoA and membrane retraction. Finally, we show that CD97 deficiency leads to a reduced T cell-independent IgM response.

*MZB use RBC mechanisensing to anchor themselves in the high sheer environment of the splenic marginal zone.*

Marginal-zone B cells anchor themselves in the marginal zone that makes contact with flowing blood in the spleen. They encounter antigens via BCR and move into the follicular zone where they pass the antigen(s) to DCs and follicular T cells for display and germinal center formation. How MZB cells know whether they are in the follicular zone or marginal zone, and the mechanisms/kinetics of this process are unknown. This paper studies the mechanism by which MZB adhere close to blood-flow areas in the marginal zone.

MZB express a GPCR called CD97, which binds to CD55 on red blood cells (RBC). The flow of blood induces a sheering force after the interaction that results in both (a) the activation of CD97 an downstream intracellular signaling as well as (b) extraction of the N-terminal fragment (NTF) of CD97 from the MZB. Extraction requires proteolytic cleavage but is ultimately driven by high sheer between RBC and MZB. Activation of CD97 leads to downstream signaling that induces integrin adhesion and induces or keeps the MZB anchored to stroma in the marginal zone. 

I'm wasn't able to determine whether the paper addresses how antigen recognition then promotes detachment/integrin release and migration into the follicular zone. The authors discuss this in the context of antigen-recognition deficiencies and the ability to mount an immune response, particularly against bacterial pathogens. They also mention that CD97 or CD55 knockout on MZB/RBC in mice leads to MZB that get swept away in blood flow, showing that CD97 activation is part of how MZB adhere in a high-sheer environment like the marginal zone.},

	abstract = {The current energy crisis, depletion of fossil fuels, and global climate change have made it imperative to find alternative sources of energy that are both economically sustainable and environmentally friendly. Here we review various pathways for converting biomass into bioenergy and biochar and their applications in producing electricity, biodiesel, and biohydrogen. Biomass can be converted into biofuels using different methods, including biochemical and thermochemical conversion methods. Determining which approach is best relies on the type of biomass involved, the desired final product, and whether or not it is economically sustainable. Biochemical conversion methods are currently the most widely used for producing biofuels from biomass, accounting for approximately 80% of all biofuels produced worldwide. Ethanol and biodiesel are the most prevalent biofuels produced via biochemical conversion processes. Thermochemical conversion is less used than biochemical conversion, accounting for approximately 20% of biofuels produced worldwide. Bio-oil and syngas, commonly manufactured from wood chips, agricultural waste, and municipal solid waste, are the major biofuels produced by thermochemical conversion. Biofuels produced from biomass have the potential to displace up to 27% of the world's transportation fuel by 2050, which could result in a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by up to 3.7 billion metric tons per year. Biochar from biomass can yield high biodiesel, ranging from 32.8% to 97.75%, and can also serve as an anode, cathode, and catalyst in microbial fuel cells with a maximum power density of 4346 mW/m2. Biochar also plays a role in catalytic methane decomposition and dry methane reforming, with hydrogen conversion rates ranging from 13.4% to 95.7%. Biochar can also increase hydrogen yield by up to 220.3%.},
	annote = {Direct combustion of biomass: heating of biomass in a furnace to directly heat or drives a steam turbine to power something. This includes oxygen-limited strategies like pyrolysis. For pyrolysis, the biomass is heated and then the biochar and released combustible gasses are burned for heat/steam. Direct combustion is more flexible than bio-conversion because any material can be burned.

Torrefaction:  biomass is fed through a heated, rotating drum with a screw-drive so that it remains heated for a specitic duration before exiting the other side as solid hydrochar. Flammable gasses are emitted during the time in the drum and these are used to drive heating of the drum and also a steam turbine etc. This can also be used with a variety of biomass materials including solid waste, and can even be done in a liquid medium at temperatures ranging from 180-260 celsius. 

Hydrothermal liquefaction: High-pressure (15-220 bar) heating (200-274 celsius) of wet biomass with a catalyst. Ideal for municiple sludge and liquid wastes/high moisture content. Product is bio-oil that is similar to crude oil and can be fractionated into traditional diesel/fuels as well as solid residue and gasses. Catalysts like sodium bicarbonate in water/ethanol medium or zeolite have been tried to improve yield. This is energy intensive.

Pyrolysis: is heating of the biomass in the absence of oxygen and yields biochar (solid), bio-oil (liquid) and combustible gas products that all have various applications. Biomasses like wood and municipal solid waste can be used. Generally, the relative yield of products depends on the temperature, heating rate and residence time. Low temperature/long residence yields more solid biochar as gaseous and liquid products have more time to polymerize. Flash pyrolysis is very fast and high temperature with low residence time and is optimized for gaseous products, while intermediate pyrolysis is optimized for bio-oil/liquid product. This process is also very energy intensive and it's difficult to get a consistent product because its composition depends on the precise temperatures/feed/heating rates.

Gasification: is one of the oldest methods that converts biomass into synthesis gasses (syngas), primarily hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane, that can be used to heat. This process involves heating the biomass at high temperature (700-1000 celsius) with low-levels of oxygen (20%, which would be air) and using a carrier medium to carry the syngas out of the reactor. Early methods (18th century) produced lots of tar and the reduction of tar is still a significant challenge that requires careful optimization of temperature, medium and feed composition. For example, steam can give better syngas hydrogen/carbon ratios, but air is the most common. Different types of ``gassifiers'' exist and differ in thre reactor design, for example, updraft and down-draft gassifiers where the feed is added either to the top or bottom of the ractor and the carrier is added to the other side. There are also fluidized gassifiers that use a liquid medium. Co-gassification is where additional materials are added to the biomass, for example, wood to municipal solid waste, to reduce unwated products like carbon monoxide. Like pyrolysis, gasification requires careful control of temperature and is sensitive to feed composition. 

Bioligical conversion

Fermentation: This inovlves the slow breakdown of sugars and carbohydrates in a biomass into biogas (hydrogen?), water, heat and fertilizer with the aid of bacteria/microorganisms. There are a variety of reactors and different types of fermentation such as dark fermentation (focus) and photo-fermentation (not discussed further). Temperature, pH, microorganism and time (hydraulic retention time) are critical factors, for example, fermentation of certain materials do better at 55C than 37C and in some studies a hydraulic retention time of 3 hours was way better than 8 hours. Fermentation is great because it's low temperature, low energy and inherently eco-friendly but it does take time and the material produced is not always consistent.

Anaerobic digestion: converts biomass to biogas (methane and carbon dioxide) and digestate (fertilizer) using microorganisms in the absence of oxygen. Lignocellulosic biomasses are a challenge for anaerobic digestion but people are developing pretreatment strategies to increase the efficiency of anaerobic digestion of these substrates (e.g. milling/grinding, acid treatment or biological pre-treatment such as with fungus to break down hemicellulose). This method is also sensitive to heat, hydraulic retention time and pH, but can break down a wide variety of biomasses including food waste and sweage.

This material possessed three-dimensional layered conductors with favorable heterojunction interface, ample hollow and porous structures. It presented remarkably enhanced electrochemical and catalytic activ- ity for both supercapacitors and overall water electrolysis. The asymmetric supercapacitors based on chitosan biochar microsphere achieved high specific capacitance (260.9 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and high energy density (81.5W h kg−1) at a power density of 978.4 W kg−1. The chitosan biochar microsphere as an electrode for electrolyze only required a low cell voltage of 1.49 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, and achieved excellent stability with 30 h continuous test at 20 mA cm−2. Then, we assembled a coupled energy storage device and hydrogen production system, the SCs as a backup power source availably guaranteed the continuous operation of overall water electrolysis. Our study pro- vides valuable perspectives into the practical design of both integrated biochar-based electrode materials and cou- pled energy storage devices with energy conversion and storage in practical.},
	annote = {splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen is a great way to produce transportable energy from an abundant source (electrocatalytic extraction, EE) because the generation and use of this energy does not produce greenhouse gasses.

The materials used for electrodes in EE, typically Ru or Pt, have a very limited energy density, are expensive and have a short lifespan. So other superconducting materials are necessary to make this process smore efficeint and scalable.

Biochar has been investigated as a substitute for these rare metals but it has a much lower conductivity and electrochemical performance. A variety of strategies have been used to not only increase the conductivity/performance but also catalyze both hydrogen and oxygen extraction from water (a bifunctional material). None of these strategies have, as yet, exceeded the necessary requirements for industrial application.

The authors designed a bifunctional ``chitosan  biochar'' that can be used as electrodes (?) for water splitting driven by supercapacitors. Their design also has the capacity to store charge as well. Given the efficiency of the device, it's charge density and electrochemical performance the authors claim they have exceeded the threshold requirements for industrial application.

Skimming through the amazing pictures in the results section. In Fig 7 and 5 it looks like the supercapacitor acts as a battery, so Fig 5 shows the performance of the capacitor in lighting some lights and running a small fan. Figure 7 shows the full system with the supercapacitor driving the splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen gas. 

So the chitosan biochar material showed multifunctional water splitting by generating both oxygen and hydroge simultaneously. The supercapacitor had an energy density of 82Wh/kg and a power density of about 980 W/kg.

The rest of this paper focuses on current use of these strategies in the global economy.
